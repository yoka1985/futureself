8/12 summary:
You’re developing an MVP to empower Dr. Joe Dispenza’s community by leveraging 320 YouTube video transcripts, aiming to inspire hope, clarify his methods, and drive donations. Initially, you scraped metadata (`videos.json`)—titles, URLs, views, likes—and paired it with raw transcripts (`transcripts_rich.json.320of370.temp`), which include `"full_text"` and `"segments"` with sentiment and voice features. You merged these into `unified_data.json`, adding derived fields like `"likes_per_view_ratio"`, `"overall_mean_sentiment"`, and `"sentiment_hope_score"` (boosted by keywords like “heal”), plus averaged voice features, to quantify hope and engagement. Now, you’re processing this with GPT-3.5-turbo via `test_llm_openai.py`, extracting structured data—gender (from text, not voice), conditions (e.g., “MS”), methods with durations (e.g., “meditation - 12 months”), discrete 1-10 scores, 5+ word hope-driven quotes (e.g., “I finally embraced boundless peace”), and unique fields like “What Doctors Said” (e.g., “You’ll be in a wheelchair”), “What Kept Me Going” (e.g., “Family support”), and “Unexpected Breakthrough” (e.g., “Heart suddenly burst with joy”). Three front-end features define the MVP: "Meditation Match Finder" (filters methods by condition, e.g., “Daily Meditation, 8.7/10 for anxiety”), "Healing Spotlight" (rotates stories with quotes and outcomes, e.g., “No anxiety, MS halted”), and "Community Insights" (updates every 3 days with stats like “60% defied grim predictions”). You’re debugging persistent JSON errors (`'"gender"'`), refining prompts, and logging raw API responses to fix output parsing. The goal: a no-backend, GitHub Pages-hosted app by April 8, 2025, costing ~$0.17 for 320 transcripts. Next steps: normalize conditions and durations, then launch to hook Joe’s followers with emotional resonance and practical clarity.







product:

 Start with a small, high-impact batch (e.g., 10-20 transcribed videos) on a simple site. Highlight hope-driven quotes to hook users and prompt donations.

Use free hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages) and raw transcripts initially. Authentic, unfiltered healing stories can drive organic growth and donations.

Prioritize transcript content over UI polish. A “donate to unlock more” button can test willingness to pay without a backend.

Structure transcripts into conditions/methods early (via LLM). A forum-style MVP could test engagement before a full app.

Leverage Dispenza’s community to refine transcripts or suggest videos. A wiki-like MVP could offload some structuring work.
