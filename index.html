Summary of Your MVP Project Goals
Your Core Goal
You're developing a minimal viable product to support Dr. Joe Dispenza's community by leveraging 320 YouTube video transcripts. The purpose is to inspire hope, clarify his methods, and potentially gather donations, all while testing if there's genuine interest before investing more resources.
MVP Must-Haves for Testing

Basic categorization/tagging of transcript content by key concepts
Mobile-responsive design using free templates

Legal Requirements (Minimal Approach)

Clear consent language specifying occasional updates only
Free tier email service (MailerLite or Brevo/SendinBlue)
